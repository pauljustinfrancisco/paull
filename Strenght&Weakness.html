                        <h5>Detail Oriented</h5>
                        <p>When it comes to details, I'm careful and concentrated; I don't want to be doing anything that I'm not even aware of. In the IT industry,
                            I keep documentation of everything I do since it makes it easier for me to complete tasks and duties accurately and effectively.</p>

                        <p>I learn things up quickly and can comprehend what's going on around me. I am able to understand and learn information about ITÂ well. 
                            Through this, I can improve my abilities more on usual in any field I choose.

                        <h5>Critical Thinking</h5>
                        <p>I find myself thinking about all the possible outcomes and consequences when I do the things I perform. As a human, I have limitations to the knowledge I possess, 
                            yet I am able to conceive of profound and creative solutions to solve problems / difficulties.

                        <p>Developing a plan and communicating with my colleagues is one of the skills I have developed. It helps me express what 
                            I know better and listen to the people around me to come up with a good idea that can help in the field of I.T..

                        <p>Behind my quick learning of things, some of this information I forget easily, that's why I'm writing them down. It may affect my performance in the field I'm going to pursue, 
                            but I'll try to hone my memory capability.</p>

                        <h5>Taking Too Much Time</h5>
                        <p>In doing tasks, I think too deeply about the things I am doing to the point of spending many hours planning to do them, 
                            which is why I take so long to finish tasks.</p>

                        <h5>Perfectionism</h5>
                        <p>Due to the long planning time, it reaches the point that my standards no longer meet because of the limits of my ability to do those things, 
                            that's why sometimes I end up procastinating and postponing tasks.</p>

                        <h5>Self-Criticism</h5>
                        <p>Because of not meeting my high standards when it comes to doing tasks, this is where I start blaming myself for not being able to do those things, 
                            but after that I will study and practice.</p>
