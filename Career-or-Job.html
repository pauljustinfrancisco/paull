                            I got interested in the Final Project "Website Creation" when our teacher assigned it to us because of the unique and gorgeous results I've seen online.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I want to be a web designer/developer since I'm currently getting more proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                            Right now, I know that I still need to learn a lot of languages connected to the website and that I can't make an excellent website right now, but when the time comes and I study it consistently and continually, 
                            I can state that I will be highly skilled and capable in this field that I might pursue a profession in.

                            I've always enjoyed playing with digital devices such as phones, computers, laptops, tablets, PSPs, and so on. 
                            Even when the Nokia brand was popular, I had fun with it.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I decided to be a Game Developer not only because I enjoy playing games, but also because I want to discover the mystery behind them and how they are created. 
                            Learning Game Development languages allows me to polish my knowledge and abilities in creating and developing it, as well as deeper understand its principles.

                            They say that you should select a job or profession that you believe you are interested in and enjoy doing, 
                            because the profession is about more than just money and compensation.
